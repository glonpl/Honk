# Honk
Are you bored with your repetitive and pointless tasks your boss wants you to do ASAP? If you are looking to entertain yourself while reviewing next spreadsheet, look no more!  
Meet [George](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sanicman/images/6/62/GSmoqxj.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20191130070117). George is ~~friendly~~ little goose, who will happily keep you company during daily basis!  
I'll let his [creator](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose) introduce him to you:

I haven't made goose application itself. I made something worse... 
## honk.bat
The honk.bat is a standalone batch script, which at first, clones this repository into the windows temporary folder. Then unpacks it into one of the user's folder, and makes sure the George will be with you every time you turn on your computer :) as every good .bat file it deletes itself after execution.  
Beware, George brings new friend after each reboot.
## ungoose.bat
This script fixes all the mess caused by honk.bat.
### Sharing == caring?
If you want to share honk.bat via internet, best way is to put it into .rar folder, not to upset windows defender. Please include ungoose.bat as well, or at least tell your friends how to get rid of George. Dont be a jerk!
# Caution
You are using that script at your own risk. The increasing geese population can radically slow your computer down. I made that script as a joke, and please make sure all people involved are having laugh.  
```diff
- Holding esc evicts George.
- ungoose.bat deletes George.
```
